            The journey from Madurai to Kodaikanal is divided into three distinct segments, each offering a unique experience:
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-primary mt-4 mb-2">Segment 1: Madurai to Batlagundu (50 km – Plains)</h3>
          <p>
            The first segment takes you through the flat agricultural plains of Dindigul district. The road is a well-maintained national highway (NH 49) with smooth driving conditions. You will pass through small towns and can stop for a traditional South Indian breakfast at one of the popular roadside restaurants near Batlagundu.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-primary mt-4 mb-2">Segment 2: Batlagundu to Perumal Malai (30 km – Foothills & Ghat Road)</h3>
          <p>
            After Batlagundu, the road begins its ascent into the Palani Hills. This is where the famous <strong>14 hairpin bends</strong> begin. The ghat road is a spectacular engineering feat, winding through dense vegetation with each turn revealing new panoramic views of the valley below. Our drivers slow down here to ensure both safety and a chance to enjoy the scenery.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-primary mt-4 mb-2">Segment 3: Perumal Malai to Kodaikanal (40 km – Hill Plateau)</h3>
          <p>
            Once you reach the plateau, the landscape transforms into rolling hills, eucalyptus groves, and pine forests. The temperature drops noticeably, and on clear days, you can see for miles. The final stretch into Kodaikanal town passes <strong>Silver Cascade Falls</strong> — a beautiful waterfall visible right from the road, where we make a brief photo stop. You arrive in Kodaikanal refreshed and ready to explore.
